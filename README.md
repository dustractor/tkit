Make a selection

just press buttons and see what happens
---


quote -> inner edges left selected ( it shrinks bit by bit leaving some edges still selected )

shift and quote ( double quote )  -> it leaves only the outside edges selected

right square bracket -> extend selection at tips along loop

left square bracket -> shrink selection at tips

control and shift and alt and end -> at the tips, unselect the tip and select the connecting edges (weird huh)

back slash -> select the crossing loops, deselect the current loops

shift and back slash -> select the next loops out, deselect the current loops

control and shift and back slash -> not sure exactly how to describe

control and shift and alt and back slash -> same. try it and see
